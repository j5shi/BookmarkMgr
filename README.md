# Launchy Plugin Collection

[Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/) is a free utility designed to help you forget about your start menu, your desktop icons, and your file manager. Launchy indexes and launches your applications, documents, project files, folders, and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes!

You can find some launchy plugins written in Python here, and you can even write your own launchy plugins with your imagination.

## Installation

Run **installer.bat**

## BookmarkMgr

BookmarkMgr is designed for opening browser bookmarks from Launchy, currently it only supports Chrome, but this can be extended easily! 

After installation, restart Launchy and rebuild the catalog, now you will be able to search your Chrome bookmarks in Launchy.
